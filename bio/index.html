I am Kenyatta Sewell Jr. from Duncanville, TX. This is my fourth year at Southwestern College and first year in Web Design. I am a Communications major with an emphasis in Broadcast Radio and Television. With this degree I plan to start a podcast with my host name Kensation. I’m not totally sure what the topics would be about I’m between sports and just general pop culture with a little bit of comedy in it. While also studying at Southwestern College I play basketball where I’m considered a junior on the court and plan to play professionally overseas when I’m done here. That’s my first option and I’ve even thought about hosting a podcast that’ll be an outlet for other overseas players to express their experiences and journeys. All in all, I plan to learn a lot from this web design class that’ll hopefully allow me to further my brand in the future.
